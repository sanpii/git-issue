title: Automaticaly stash before switching branch

type: enhancement

Currently, you cannot show/list/wathever issues when you work on your code (git
switch branch requires clean work tree).

``git_issue_switch_branch`` could make ``stash save`` before switching and
``git_issue_restore_branch`` a ``stash pop``.

There should be no conflict. But how to determine whether to make a
``stash pop``?
